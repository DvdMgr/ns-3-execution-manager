<h1 class="title">A Simulation Execution Manager for ns-3</h1>
</header>
<p>A Google Summer of Code 2018 project.</p>
<p>Developed by Davide Magrin under the mentorship of Dizhi Zhou for the <a href="https://www.nsnam.org">ns-3</a> project.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<p>The aim of this project is to provide a way for users of the ns-3 Network Simulator to easily manage simulation campaigns, going from running simulation scripts to visualizing results in as few steps as possible.</p>
<p>While it’s very easy to run ns-3 simulations, up to now there was no ready-to-use solution for running multiple simulations to extract statistically meaningful results. ns-3 users had to rely on custom-written scripts, leading to duplicated effort and solutions that were difficult to share with others due to their customization.</p>
<p>With this GSoC project, I hope to have laid down the foundation for a more collaborative effort on part of the ns-3 community, and to have made some steps of ns-3 use easier for newcomers.</p>
<p>Further details on the scope and motivation of the project can be found in the original <a href="resources/GSoC_proposal.pdf">GSoC proposal</a>.</p>
<h3 id="code-and-documentation">Code and documentation</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/DvdMgr/sem">Github repo</a> was used to host all the work that was completed during the GSoC period. The state of the repository at the end GSoC can be accessed at the <a href="https://github.com/DvdMgr/sem/tree/gsoc-final">gsoc-final</a> git tag. Similarly, tags named gsoc-week2 through gsoc-week13 track the progress for each week. Aside from a <a href="https://github.com/DvdMgr/sem/pull/15">pull request</a> merged in week 12, all code in the repository was written by Davide Magrin.</p>
<p>Documentation for the project is hosted at <a href="https://simulationexecutionmanager.readthedocs.io">ReadTheDocs</a>. Examples including a showcase of the obtainable results are described in the <a href="https://simulationexecutionmanager.readthedocs.io/en/develop/examples.html">examples page</a>.</p>
<p>Build status can be checked through <a href="https://travis-ci.org/DvdMgr/sem">Travis CI</a>.</p>
<h4 id="quick-install">Quick install</h4>
<p>The developed program can be installed through pip:</p>
<pre><code>pip3 install https://github.com/DvdMgr/sem/archive/gsoc-final.zip</code></pre>
<p>To get started using the command line interface, just run:</p>
<pre><code>sem --help</code></pre>
<h3 id="state-of-the-project">State of the project</h3>
<p>All features of the original proposal were fully developed. Additionally, a command line interface for the library was also added. A detailed history of the progress was kept at <a href="https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/GSoC2018:_A_Simulation_Execution_Manager_for_ns-3">the project’s ns-3 wiki page</a>.</p>
<p>Additional items that came up (and are not essential to the core functionality of the library) were converted to <a href="https://github.com/DvdMgr/sem/issues">Github Issues</a> and tagged with the enhancement label. I plan to keep working on these items in my spare time.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to note that, since the developed code has already become part of my workflow when using ns-3, I plan to keep developing the library as main contributor as long as I will work with ns-3 (at least a couple more years, until completion of my PhD, and maybe beyond that point).</p>
<h3 id="things-ive-learned">Things I’ve learned</h3>
<p>Technologies and workflows I got to learn more about during the GSoC period include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools for Python project management and development;</li>
<li>Open source project maintenance:
<ul>
<li>Working with pull requests;</li>
<li>Managing issues;</li>
<li>Coordinating contributors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Thorough testing practices;</li>
<li>Usage of continuous integration tools;</li>
<li>The DRMAA API;</li>
<li>Usage of various Python libraries.</li>
</ul>
